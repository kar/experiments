# Buck experiments

This repo contains (hopefully) working examples of various non-trivial buck configurations and use case scenarios.

So far it means:

- Buck + Kotlin + Android
-- Build Kotlin code with Android dependencies (including generated R.java)

# How to run it

- ‘cp ~/.android/debug.keystore apps/gs.kar.buckexp/’
